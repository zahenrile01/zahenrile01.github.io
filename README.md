*Regional Profitability*: Profit performance is heavily concentrated in states like California and New York, while several central and southern states show significant losses that weaken overall regional stability. 

*Product Performance*: Technology drives most of the profit through high-margin Copiers and Phones, whereas Furniture remains a major loss area due to underperforming Tables and Bookcases. 

*Sales Distribution by Segment*: The Consumer segment dominates total sales, with Corporate and Home Office contributing smaller but still meaningful portions. 

*Top Selling States*: A small group of states, led by California, New York, and Washington, accounts for the highest sales volumes, while others remain substantially lower. 

*Profit by Product*: Copiers deliver the strongest margins within Technology, while losses from Tables and Bookcases continue to drag down category-level profitability.
